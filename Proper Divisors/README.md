An integer, n, is said to be perfect when the sum of all of the proper divisors of n is
equal to n. For example, 28 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2,
4, 7 and 14, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
The function determines whether or not a positive integer is perfect. The
function will take one parameter. If that parameter is a perfect number then
function will return true. Otherwise it will return false. In addition, the main program
uses the function to identify and display all of the perfect numbers between 1
and 10,000.
