A line of best fit is a straight line that best approximates a collection of n data points.
In this project, I assumed that each point in the collection has an x coordinate
and a y coordinate. The symbols x¯ and y¯ are used to represent the average x value in
the collection and the average y value in the collection respectively.

The program reads a collection of points from the user. The user will enter
the x part of the first coordinate on its own line, followed by the y part of the first
coordinate on its own line. Program allows the user to continue entering coordinates, with the
x and y parts each entered on their own line, until program reads a blank line for
the x coordinate. It displays the formula for the line of best fit in the form y = mx + b
For example, if the user inputs the coordinates (1, 1), (2, 2.1) and (3, 2.9) then
program displays y = 0.95x + 0.1.
